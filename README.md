##  Run the code in your local system 
#### To run the code in your local system, you can install the packages in the given `requirements.txt` using `pip`
```bash
    $ pip install --upgrade pip
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

####  Additionally you can also create your own local environment using the following command if you are linux user:
``` bash
    $  python3 -m venv intro2ml
    $  source intro2ml/bin/activate
```
#### For Windows user use `.\scripts\activate` to activate the current virtual environment. Post that install the necessary packages as stated above and you are good to go!
#### Please ensure you name the environment as `intro2ml`. We don't want to track the local dependencies, hence this environment has been added to the `.gitignore`.
